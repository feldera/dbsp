# Introduction

Describe briefly DBSP and the SQL compiler.

## Supported SQL Constructs

SQL as a language has been standardized for a long time.
Unfortunately, the standard leaves underspecified many important
behaviors. Thus each SQL implementation is slightly different.

The SQL to DBSP compiler is implemented on top of the [Apache
Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) infrastructure. While Calcite is a very
flexible and customizable platform, it makes several choices regarding the SQL
language semantics. Our implementation mostly follows these choices. This
document describes specifics of our implementation.
